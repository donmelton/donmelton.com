title: 15 things Kurt Vonnegut said better than anyone else ever has or will
---
During a conversation on App.net today, [Dalton Caldwell](https://alpha.app.net/dalton) linked to [this article](http://www.avclub.com/article/15-things-kurt-vonnegut-said-better-than-anyone-el-1858) to source a snippet from Kurt Vonnegut he had [just posted](https://alpha.app.net/dalton/post/2560428).

Today isn't the anniversary of anything significant in Vonnegut's life. At least, not that I know of. And this article dates back to 2007, the year we were all robbed of his acerbic wit. But I never saw it before.

And I'm fascinated by the selection and exegesis of each of these quotations. My favorite of the fifteen is this koan from "Cat's Cradle" regarding the curse of sentience:

> Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder, "Why, why, why?" Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.

Dalton Caldwell liked that one too. So much so, it was the very [first post](https://alpha.app.net/dalton/post/3) he made --- and only the third anyone ever made --- to App.net. Good start, sir.

So it goes.
