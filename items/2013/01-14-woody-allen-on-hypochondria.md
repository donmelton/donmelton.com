title: Woody Allen on hypochondria
---
Differentiating himself from a common hypochondriac, Woody Allen writes:

> What I am is an alarmist, which is in the same ballpark as the hypochondriac or, should I say, the same emergency room. Still there is a fundamental difference. I don’t experience imaginary maladies --- my maladies are real.

You can't help but hear his voice in your head as your read the essay. It's old schtick but it's classic schtick. Good to see him writing something besides screenplays these days. More, please.
