title: I'm on the "Debug" podcast this week
---
My thanks to Guy English and Rene Ritchie for inviting me on their podcast. I don't know what they were thinking but they're good people anyway.

Apparently we talked for an hour and a half. At least that's the length of Rene's final edit. I don't remember half of what I said, but I certainly enjoyed droning on and on at those two. I might have mentioned Safari and WebKit maybe once or twice. And used the "F" word --- you know, just so you're certain it was me.
