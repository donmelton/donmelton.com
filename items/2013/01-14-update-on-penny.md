title: Update on Penny
---
Based on questions I keep getting on Twitter, App.net and elsewhere, let me update you on Penny, our Labrador Retriever, who [stopped eating recently](/2012/12/31/worried-about-penny/). Thank you all for your concern and my apologies for not posting this sooner. Penny has fully recovered. She's no longer on an appetite stimulant and is eating normally --- which means everything she can find. And we hope she keeps doing that for a long time.
