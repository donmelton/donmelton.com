title: As you wish, another '80s movie podcast
---
If you enjoyed the "[RoboCop](http://www.imore.com/ad-hoc-7-robocop)" show that [Rene Ritchie](https://twitter.com/reneritchie) recorded with [Guy English](https://twitter.com/gte), [Matt Drance](https://twitter.com/drance) and myself last month, then we have another '80s movie diversion for you --- an inconceivable[^1] celebration of "[The Princess Bride](http://www.imore.com/ad-hoc-08-princess-bride)" that the four of us recorded last week.

That makes three '80s movie podcasts so far, starting with "[Dune](http://www.imore.com/ad-hoc-5-dune)" way back in August. And we plan to do still more. Seriously, one of these every month. We're just crazy like that.

We're focusing on '80s movies because an ancient relic of that era, me, is available to do stream-of-unconsciousness commentary with folks who were probably children back then. And people wonder why I'm called "Gramps."
