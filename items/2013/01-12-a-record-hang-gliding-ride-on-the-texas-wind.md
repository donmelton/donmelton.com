title: A record hang gliding ride on the Texas wind
---
A neat mixed media presentation by The New York Times to clearly explain what Jonny Durand and Dustin Martin did and how they did it.[^1] Of course, that was 475 miles and they still didn't make it out of Texas.

Made me wonder how long it's been since I took my first flight --- a powered one --- in the aborted pursuit of a [private pilot license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence). Had to consult my log book. Turns out it was six years ago --- yesterday. D'oh! Didn't even celebrate.

What I should really do is haul my ass back to the airport and into that little [Citabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Champion_Citabria) again to finish getting my ticket.
