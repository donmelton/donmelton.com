title: When your house is burning down, you should brush your teeth
---
Just a throwaway line from this Web comic at The Oatmeal:

> (My childhood was The Shawshank Redemption of cat shit)

At least I wasn't [eating this time](/2012/12/18/this-is-the-web-right-now/) while reading that website.

When I grow up, I want to be able to tell stories like Matthew Inman. The man knows how to open a vein and get you laughing while he bleeds.
