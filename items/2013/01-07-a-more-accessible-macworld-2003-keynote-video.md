title: A more accessible MacWorld 2003 keynote video
---
Via Twitter, [Jan Lehnardt let me know](https://twitter.com/janl/status/288335969353089024) that [the video I posted earlier](/2013/01/07/macworld-2003-keynote/) was not accessible to him in Germany. Damn. My apologies. This is another reason why embedding videos on your website is often problematic. So, just in case this might be happening to others outside the United States of YouTube, [here's another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ZNXQujgXw) Jan found which does work for him. Maybe it will work for you, too. Keep in mind that this is not a complete version of the presentation. It's missing the description of the technology behind Safari at the end.
