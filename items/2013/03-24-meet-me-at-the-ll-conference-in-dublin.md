title: Meet me at the Úll conference in Dublin
---
I'll be speaking at the [Úll conference](http://2013.ull.ie/) in Dublin, Ireland sometime during April. Thanks to Paul Campbell and Dermot Daly for the invitation, and thanks to [Jim Dalrymple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/04/30/ull-conference-is-the-best-ive-ever-attended/) for talking me into it.

I got a chance to meet Paul at a four-hour lunch last week. He's obviously both considerate and crazy enough to endure me talking for that long. Perhaps you are too.

If you like the content here at this website, my session will be like a really long-ass blog post. Except that you won't have to read it. I'll "perform" it live. Whatever the hell that means. Now I just have to finish writing it before I show up next month.

Of course, there are many other fine folks speaking at and joining in the conversation at the conference. I look forward to meeting them all.

See you there.
