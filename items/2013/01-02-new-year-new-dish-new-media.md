Andrew Sullivan on taking [his website](http://www.andrewsullivan.com) rogue supported by subscription only, without advertising:

> No bigger media companies will be subsidizing us; no venture capital will be sought to cushion our transition (unless my savings count as venture capital); and, most critically, no advertising will be getting in the way.

Many other sites offer subscriptions these days but very few eschew advertising. Props to Andrew and his team for trying it. I hope they succeed. And if they don't, I suspect many of those big media companies will be willing to hire them.

As a reformed conservative, I've always found his blog engaging --- even when it's not focused on politics. Of course, with so many posts per day, subscribing to the RSS feed there is rather like drinking from a firehose.
