title: Thank you all
---
Despite my sad lack of faith in humanity, people online have been unfailingly polite and nice in their feedback about what I'm doing here. Thank you all. I shouldn't have been surprised. My apologies. And if I haven't responded yet to one of your questions at Twitter or App.net, don't be afraid to ask again --- I might have missed your message.
