[Dalton Caldwell](https://alpha.app.net/dalton) after watching [Phil Elvrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Elvrum) perform his solo act:

> Going "indie" is clearly not for everyone, but I have the utmost respect for the people that are able and willing to do it.

Read the whole story of how Dalton arrived at that thought. It's such a wonderful reminder of the courage people must summon to venture out on their own. I immediately sent this article to a friend who recently left Apple to start her own business. Just seemed an appropriate way to tell her how much I respect what she's doing.
