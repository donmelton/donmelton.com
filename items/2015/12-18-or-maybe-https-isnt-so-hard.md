title: Or maybe HTTPS isn't so hard
---
Minutes. Maybe even seconds after I published that [last post](/2015/12/17/moving-to-https-is-hard/)... Voil√†! My new static IP address propagates through DNS, HTTPS works perfectly, and I sound like a cranky old guy. Again.

They tell me comedy is all about timing.

Anyway, I pushed out the new content changes and, of course, they worked perfectly too. Dammit! You really can switch to HTTPS in less than half a day. Even if you're an idiot like me.

But I had help. Props to [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) and [MaxCDN](https://www.maxcdn.com/) for how easy their systems are to use. I recommend them both.

Moral of this story? Remain calm and don't fear the encryption.
