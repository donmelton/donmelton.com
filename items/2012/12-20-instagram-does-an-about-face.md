title: Instagram does an about-face
---
The New York Times on Instagram's [what-was-old-is-now-new terms of service](http://blog.instagram.com/post/38421250999/updated-terms-of-service-based-on-your-feedback) released this evening:

> Following a reaction that included customers defecting to other services, Mr. Systrom told Instagram users on Tuesday that the new policy had been misinterpreted. "It is our mistake that this language is confusing," he wrote, and he promised an updated agreement.
> 
> That statement apparently was not enough. With more people leaving the service, the company, which Facebook bought for $735 million this year, reacted again by returning to the old rules.

Well, that didn't take long. As I [wrote earlier](/2012/12/18/thank-you-and-were-listening/), it's not a good public relations move to get feedback by pissing everyone off.
