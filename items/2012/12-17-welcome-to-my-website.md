title: Welcome to my website
---
I think this may be the third or fourth weblog I've started. I forget. Most of them are lying somewhere in the HTML bin of history. God willing they're all buried deep in there. I don't want to see them again. And you shouldn't either.

All of my previous attempts died from that dreaded self-publishing disease --- neglect. Some would say they just died from bad writing. My plan is for this vanity website to avoid those fates. It at least has a better chance of survival now that I'm retired with plenty of time to write something important. And that was the excuse I made for retiring too --- writing something important. Dammit, the pressure.

I'm not sure yet what my focus will be here. Probably random, at least in the beginning. Poor planning to start with entropy, I know. But I'm sure to write about my time at Apple and the development of Safari and WebKit. Inside stories you haven't heard. Such a tease. Maybe I can mete them out slowly so as to gin up the book deal and movie rights.

Seriously, there will be no gossip or name calling here. I still respect the people I've worked with and have no reason to betray their trust. If those were the droids you were looking for, move along.

I will write about my tinkering which created this website. As well as my other strange hobbies and stranger family. Not only am I a bad writer, I'm a bad photographer too. Likely you'll see evidence of that.

When I find something interesting on the Web, I plan to link to it here provided I can add real value in a commentary. Or make a smug, thoughtless joke about it. Along with small observations and long essays, I may even post some fiction --- besides all that biographical crap I mentioned earlier.

Anyway, you're invited to watch my efforts. And join in commenting about them. But elsewhere, please. On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/donmelton) or [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/donmelton) is best since I'm also there. You can write about my work on your own site too and [let me know](/contact/) that you've done so. You know how this works --- the great circle jerk of the Internet.

So, welcome. Let's begin.
