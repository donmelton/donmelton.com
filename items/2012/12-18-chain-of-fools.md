title: Chain of fools

<%= youtube 'sjcyCLjEHpo', :aspect => '16x9' %>

I know this chain of fools. At least the guitarist, drummer and bassist. They all used to work for me at Apple. That's Red Dutta, the manager of OS X Calendar and Reminders on guitar, Terry Blanchard, the manager of OS X Mail and Notes on drums, and Jim Luther, a Core Services senior engineer on bass. The rest of the band are either Apple or ex-Apple too.

And they're all doing a damn good version of that tune. No idea when they find the time to practice.

Lucky for them that they didn't need Tim Cook's approval for their set that night. Although there's a good chance he's an Aretha Franklin fan anyway.
