title: Thank you, and we're listening

Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, on the shitstorm they created with their [new privacy policy and terms of service](http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/) released yesterday: 

> One of the main reasons these documents don’t take effect immediately, but instead 30 days from now, is that we wanted to make sure you had an opportunity to raise any concerns. You’ve done that and are doing that, and that will help us provide the clarity you deserve.

Sorry, but I've got to call bullshit on that. There were so many extreme reactions by everyone, including myself, to Instagram's new advertising model and ownership rights after reading that document, that it's unclear whether it just wasn't properly vetted ahead of time or they panicked and pedaled backwards from the precipice. It wasn't us. It was Instagram being vague, misleading or stupid.

Not a good public relations move to get feedback by pissing everyone off. Next time they should be saying, "Thank you, and we're thinking."
