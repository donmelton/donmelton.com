Here in the United States, there's no need to make jokes about Mayans when you have [John Boehner](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/12/boehners-plan-b-fail.php) and the [NRA](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/12/wayne-lapierre-newtown-massacre.php) to provide so much better material. Unfortunately, what they're doing is not a joke. We really are doomed.
