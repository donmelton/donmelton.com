title: That other first flight

I originally planned to launch this website on Tuesday, December 18, because I didn't think I'd be ready until then. When I got up this morning I remembered the historical significance of December 17 and I had to go for it a day earlier.

By significance, I don't mean these birthdays:

* [Milla Jovovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milla_Jovovich) (1975)
* [Bill Pullman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pullman) (1954)
* [Eugene Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Levy) (1946)
* [William Safire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire) (1929)
* [Ludwig van Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven) (1770)

Sure, if it weren't for Milla Jovovich, none of us would know the word "[multipass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/quotes?qt=qt0464086)." And I hear that Ludwig fellow made quite a bit of noise in his time.

No, I'm talking about those two crazy bicycle engineers, [Orville and Wilbur Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers), who back in 1903 [launched and flew the first successful powered aircraft](http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/gal100/wright1903.html). Now those guys were real entrepreneurs. I've been to [Kitty Hawk in North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Hawk,_North_Carolina) and I know how bat-shit insane it must have been to climb into that experiment of spruce and ash, muslin and metal --- particularly in all that cold December wind and so close to the Atlantic.

So, thank you, gentlemen. Otherwise I'd be sharing my anniversary with [Darryl Strawberry pleading not guilty on tax evasion charges](http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1994/december_18_1994_171226.html).
