title: Regarding Instagram's new TOS
---
Wil Wheaton on [Instagram's new privacy policy and terms of service](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/) which allow using your photos in advertisements:

> If someone Instagrams a photo of Seth Green walking through an Urban Outfitters, does that mean Urban Outfitters can take that image and use it to create an implied endorsement by Seth?

When I first heard about this inevitable dick move by Instagram for making money, I thought about ordinary people and not celebrities. It's a whole other set of real and complicated legal problems for folks who make their living with their faces. Best of luck to everyone on this mess.

My advice? Find another free service to post pictures of your pets having lunch that isn't big enough yet to sell you as a product.
