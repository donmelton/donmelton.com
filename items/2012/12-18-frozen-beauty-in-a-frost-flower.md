This is called a [frost flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_flower). This [particular photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/markinspex/6477498033/) is of a rabbit frost. I had no idea such a phenomenon existed. That's what I get for living in a Mediterranean-like climate.

So fragile and incomplete looking. It could be the detritus of making cotton candy or spinning glass. Or something the elves left behind.
