title: Search doesn't work yet
---
Please note that the search field in the sidebar isn't working yet. The code in the HTML form is correct but you won't get any useful results because [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), my search engine of choice, hasn't indexed any of my brand spanking new Web pages yet. But neither have Google nor Bing so it's not a particular failing of DuckDuckGo. This is the bane of websites without built-in search engines. You have to wait and wait and wait for the search engine crawler to think you're important. Which really says a lot about me and my website.
