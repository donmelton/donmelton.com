title: BBEdit 10.5.1 update (still) doesn't suck
---
Buried inside the [BBEdit 10.5.1 release notes](http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/arch_bbedit1051.html):

> FIXED BUG IN WHICH KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS IN MODAL DIALOGS DIDNT WORK WHEN THE CAPS LOCK KEY WAS ENGAGED OK

Another fun thing about using BBEdit is its developers obvious love of self-deprecating whimsy. And they've always been this way. Just read the marketing copy for the latest version of their editor: "It's ooh shiny" and "it (still) doesn't suck."

And although that's a big list of issues, I never hit a single one of those bugs. They still fixed them quickly. That's how seriously they take the quality of their product. A good balance.

Don't ever change, guys.
